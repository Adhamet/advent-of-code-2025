# Part 1:
I'm frustrated with this puzzle. I'm frustrated that the solution required to solve the problem only requires you to only work with the real input and not the sample. I always code my solutions such that they work with the sample data before applying to the real data. This is the first time this happened and it took me a-lot of time, to miserably fail and then having to figure out through online solutions that all you need to do is to check if we can stack each present in it's 3x3 space together or not, that's it because each region in the actual puzzle input is much larger than needed to fit the presents so all the presents actual fit it easily..  

# Part 2:
And apparently through reading part 2, this was the intended solution.  
Anyway, after a-lot of work and great problems and also disappointing ones, and now that Advent Of Code is done: I'm proud that I've tried my best in this journey of bash with Advent Of Code, I don't think I've ever went fully through a year of Advent Of Code before so I'm really happy that I also had the opportunity to explore bash and get used to the language, now that I've gotten a bit used to the syntax of the language, I'm ready to take the next step and actually get bash in a lot of action!  
And hopefully I'll come back next year stronger and doing harder challenges, thank you for checking out my repo!
